# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: April 1st, 2022 
**Today's Progress**: 
- Read on the if statements in C language.
- Covered bits on switches as well.

**Thoughts:** 
- If statements gives choices on a program when trying to execute it.
- Switches are used in place of too many else if. Having too many else if on a program is considered a bad practice.

### Day 1: April 2nd, 2022 
**Today's Progress**: 
- Worked on Logical operators in C language
- Did some numerical examples programs.

**Thoughts:** 
- I comprehended concepts on how logical operators are functioning. The three logical operators &&, || and !. It was a good experience all along knowing these are functioning and how they relate to each other. 
- && (AND) checks to see if two conditions are true.
- || (OR) checks if at least one condition is true.
- ! (NOT) reverses the state of a condition
