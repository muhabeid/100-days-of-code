# Overall log of n Days of Code!
This is an overall log that contains all the days that I will be coding. All progress will be recorded here and the relevant round of days as well recorded to the relevant .md file.

### Day 0: April 1st, 2022 
**Today's Progress**: 
- Read on the if statements in C language.
- Covered bits on switches as well.

**Thoughts:** 
- If statements gives choices on a program when trying to execute it.
- Switches are used in place of too many else if. Having too many else if on a program is considered a bad practice.

- [Switches](https://github.com/muhabeid/bro-code/blob/main/C-files/13-switches.c)

### Day 1: April 2nd, 2022 
**Today's Progress**: 
- Worked on Logical operators in C language
- Did some numerical examples programs.

**Thoughts:** 
- I comprehended concepts on how logical operators are functioning. The three logical operators &&, || and !. It was a good experience all along knowing these are functioning and how they relate to each other. 
- && (AND) checks to see if two conditions are true.
- || (OR) checks if at least one condition is true.
- ! (NOT) reverses the state of a condition

### Day 2: April 3rd, 2022
**Today's Progress:**
- Did some revision on C introduction and covered it in details.

**Thoughts:**
- Was nice recalling and adding some new information to what I already knew on the C data types, variables and constants, input and outputs together with identifiers and the rule that follow along.

### Day 3: April 4th, 2022 
**Today's Progress:** 
- Reviewed work on arguments and parameters and how they are called to fucntion in C.
- Did some examples programs.

**Thoughts:** 
- Arguments and parameters are used to remove the repetition in writting programs. They are used as declared functions.

I missed out on two days consecutive, I was not feeling well and was kinda down bad.

### Day 4: April 7th, 2022
**Today's Progress:**
-   Went through Ternary operators and functions prototypes in C.
-   Ternary operators are very useful in that they reduce the use of if/else and make it easier using the general formula of (condition) ? value if true : value if false.
-   Function prototypes ensures that calls to a function are made with the correct number and type arguments.

**Thoughts:**
-   The two takes for the day were great to practice with knowing how they make writting code easy. Looking forward to working them more frequently.

### Day 5: April 8th, 2022
**Today's Progress:**
-   Today was all about string functions in C.
-   String functions need to be declared first with a header that contains many string functions. 

**Thoughts:**
-    It was basically an introduction of strings and how different type of string function can be called to function, as I progress further down the course.. I'll get to see more strings functions and what they bring to the table.
