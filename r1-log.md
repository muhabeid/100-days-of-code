# Round 1 of 100 Days of Code.

### Day 0: April 1st, 2022 
**Today's Progress:** 
- Read on the if statements in C language.
- Covered bits on switches as well.

**Thoughts:** 
- If statements gives choices on a program when trying to execute it.
- Switches are used in place of too many else if. Having too many else if on a program is considered a bad practice.

- [Switches](https://github.com/muhabeid/bro-code/blob/main/C-files/13-switches.c)

### Day 1: April 2nd, 2022 
**Today's Progress:** 
- Worked on Logical operators in C language
- Did some numerical examples programs.

**Thoughts:** 
- I comprehended concepts on how logical operators are functioning. The three logical operators &&, || and !. It was a good experience all along knowing these are functioning and how they relate to each other. 
- && (AND) checks to see if two conditions are true.
- || (OR) checks if at least one condition is true.
- ! (NOT) reverses the state of a condition

### Day 2: April 3rd, 2022
**Today's Progress:**
- Did some revision on C introduction and covered it in details.

**Thoughts:**
- Was nice recalling and adding some new information to what I already knew on the C data types, variables and constants, input and outputs together with identifiers and the rule that follow along.

### Day 3: April 4th, 2022 
**Today's Progress:** 
- Reviewed work on arguments and parameters and how they are called to fucntion in C.
- Did some examples programs.

**Thoughts:** 
- Arguments and parameters are used to remove the repetition in writting programs. They are used as declared functions.
