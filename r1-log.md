# Round 1 of 100 Days of Code.

### Day 0: April 1st, 2022 
**Today's Progress:** 
- Read on the if statements in C language.
- Covered bits on switches as well.

**Thoughts:** 
- If statements gives choices on a program when trying to execute it.
- Switches are used in place of too many else if. Having too many else if on a program is considered a bad practice.
